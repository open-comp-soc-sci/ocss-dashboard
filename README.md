There exists no comprehensive solution to appraise the sentiment of online social media platforms. This is a pressing issue, as the use of these platforms is ubiquitous, especially for members of marginalized communities. Despite endless hours spent using these platforms by everyday users, research of the messagesâ€™ contents is not immediately apparent, straightforward, or accessible. Research into the opinions and experiences shared within these communities can offer altruistic opportunities, especially the dissemination of medical outcomes and their success rates.

To enable this accessibility, as a juncture of computer science and social science, this website is built with React and Flask to bridge the gap between otherwise unwieldy magnitudes of text data and straightforward sentiment analysis. This project intends to help social scientists analyze these social platforms. The website will likely go on to contain more advanced features within its lifetime, including measuring linguistic trends and interactions between groups on the Internet.

Which computers to use?

typically any computer should be able to run the 
backend + db + frontend + rabbit, that is done using docker compose.

```bash
make
```

However, we need another computer with a strong enough GPU that
can host Ollama.

```bash
cd backend/llama
make
cd ../topic
make
```
